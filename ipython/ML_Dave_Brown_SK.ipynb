Specifically we aim to generate the pattern for a fabric shirt with a fit tailored to a specific body.  The measurements of the body are assumed to have a normally distributed error, typical with any manual measuring process.  The density and elasticity of the fabric are also assumed to be known only with error.  We use a mass-spring model of the fabric to generate the drap profile on the body and calculate a fit score that we will use as the utility for the optimization.  The first pass of the utility score will be based on the tension in the mass-spring model (too much tension is too tight), but additional heuristics may prove useful to get a good shirt fit.\n\nWe plan to use a genetic algorithm or simulated annealing to find the ideal fabric shape for a set of parameters.  In order to determine the probability density function (PDF) of optimal shapes from the entire space of our noisy parameters we will use a monte carlo method. \n\nTo demonstrate success of the method we will visualize the most-likely optimal fit in its 3D form and the PDF of optimal fits in a heatmap overlaid on the 2D form.  We will consider realizing the most-likely fit as an actual garment, but our sewing skills are woefully lacking, and will likely prevent that.\n\nThis problem has been considered before, but without the uncertainty.  It has useful applications for creating optimized structures with advanced composite materials [1].  \n\n\nPart of the optimization requires modeling cloth.  The physical simulation of fabric has an extensive body literature, often intertwined with the computer graphics field.  We only cite a small sample of this work, but think [2],[3], [4] and [5] are relevant to our own project.\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "** Solid body model **", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "** Mass-Spring model of fabric **\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "**Joint solid body-fabric model **", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "** Optimization **", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "** Results and Discussion **", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "** Conclusion **\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "** References **<br>\n[1] Masaki Aono, Paolo Denti, David E Breen and Michael J Wozny \u201cFitting a woven cloth model to a curved surface: Dart insertion\u201d.
