    "A mass sping model is a decent approximation for cloth or any thin shelled material.  The model is made up of a mesh of nodes interconnected with edges.  The nodes have a mass $m$ and the edges have a spring contant $k$, length $len$, and a natural resting length $len_{rest}$.  The force of gravity is included with, using the normal gravitational constant, $g=<0,0,-9.8>$.\n",
